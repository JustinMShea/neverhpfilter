\section{Notes}{

The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed as a
percentage of the labor force. Labor force data are restricted to
people 16 years of age and older, who currently reside in 1 of the 50
states or the District of Columbia, who do not reside in institutions
(e.g., penal and mental facilities, homes for the aged), and who are
not on active duty in the Armed Forces.

This rate is also defined as the U-3 measure of labor underutilization.

The series comes from the 'Current Population Survey (Household Survey)'

The source code is: LNU04000000
